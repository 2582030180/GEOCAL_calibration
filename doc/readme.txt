###camera settings:
Exposure program: Manual
Aperture number: No specification
ISO value: Smallest possible (e.g. 50, 100)
Autofocus: OFF
ExposureTime: For best results, the exposure should be selected so that the individual light points are not saturated (i.e. no white pixels or a minimum number of white pixels in the center of each point), with the exception of the zeroth order.
file format: TIFF recommended, PNG, BMP and JPG supported

###camera position& suitable lenses：
Distance: a minimum distance is not required.
Decenter: The optical axis of the lens should be aligned approximately perpendicular to the DOE(the zeroth diffraction order)
FOV: Make sure that the dot grid covers the entire image and that the edge of the DOE is not visible.
rotation: A rotation of the camera around the optical axis of approx. +/- 2° is tolerated.
Lens Diameter:  not exceed a diameter of 77 mm for Geocal/Geocal IR or 155 mm for Geocal XL in order to capture the dot grid in full format.
environment: Dark environment to avoid stray light, reflections and similar disturbing factors.
